# Teams API - OpenAPI Specification

This directory contains the OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification for the Teams API.

## Files

- `openapi-spec.yaml` - Complete OpenAPI specification for the Teams API

## Overview

The Teams API provides endpoints for managing:
- **People** (Players and Trainers) - Unified endpoint for managing both players and trainers
- **Events** - Soccer events with team management and player invitations
- **Shirt Sets** - Equipment management for team jerseys

## Key Features

### Unified People Endpoint
Instead of separate `/players` and `/trainers` endpoints, the API uses a single `/people` endpoint with role-based filtering:

```
GET /api/people?role=player    # Get all players
GET /api/people?role=trainer   # Get all trainers
GET /api/people                # Get both players and trainers
```

### Event Management
Complete event lifecycle management:
- Create events with teams
- Invite players to events
- Track invitation responses (open/accepted/declined)
- Manage team player selection

### Equipment Tracking
Manage shirt sets with individual shirt assignments to players.
